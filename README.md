# Movie Genre Classifier

## Overview
This project is designed to predict the genre of movies based on their titles and synopses. It employs a TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical format and a Random Forest Classifier for making genre predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
4. Execute the main script: `python predict.py`.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is not publicly available due to copyright reasons. However, you can replace it with any movie dataset having a title and synopsis for each entry.

## Model Performance
The model performed verry well on the test set. For more details, refer to the evaluation notebook.

## Future Work
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
- Fine-tune model hyperparameters.
- Extend the project to include more features, like director and cast.
